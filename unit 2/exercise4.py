# 1) Using an existing stats dataframe: 
stats = weeklyPlayerStats(2024, "RB", 17)  
plot_player_stat(stats, stat="rushing_yards", top_n=20, title="RB Rushing Yards (2024)", save_path="qb_passing_yards_2024.png"  )

# 2) One-liner wrapper:
# plot_weekly_player_stats(2024, "WR", stat="receiving_yards", top_n=15, week=[1,2,3], save_path="wr_rec_yards_wk1-3.png")

# Use the new plot_player_stat() and plot_weekly_player_stats() to visualize the data into bar graphs and answer the following questions.

# 1. Use each helper function to find your own metric to visualize. use the weeklyPlayerStats function to find positions and stat columns by name

# 3. find the player with the highest total passing yards in 2024.
